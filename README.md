# hello-world

Hello, my name is Ruben or Rakinator on Github.
I live in the Netherlands and I'm 18 years old.

I don't have much coding experience at the moment but I want to learn how to make websites.
This means I want to learn HTML, CSS and Javascript.
Mayby I'll also learn Java or C# for software development. 

If you have tips on how to start learning how to code then please tell me!! :)
